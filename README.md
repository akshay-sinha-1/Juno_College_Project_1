# Juno_College_Project_1

For My first project, I am given a design and my task is to match the design as closely as possible while writing semantic HTML, CSS and using Flexbox to help  achieve my layout.

Project 1: I am given the task of building a site from one of the provided designs below. This project is meant to call upon everything the course has covered.

This project must be responsive, meaning it should work on smaller screen sizes, with the smallest screen size being around 320px in width.

Browse the designs below and when you find one that speaks to you, get started building your site! Each project comes with a desktop and mobile design along with assets.
